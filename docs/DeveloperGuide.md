## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ExerciseListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ExerciseBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an exercise).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Exercise>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Exercise` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Exercise` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the exercise book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Updating an exercise

Author: Lee Wei Min

This section details how an `Exercise` is modified using the `update` command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The update command 
updates an existing exercise, where all fields are optional but at least one field to update must
be specified. For more details, please refer to the [update section](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w17-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#33-update-exercises--update) of the user guide
</div>

#### Implementation

We will use the following example command: `update 1 d/30 c/260 m/chest t/home`.

The below sequence diagram details the execution flow:

Here are the steps:
- Step 1: `LogicManager` calls its  `execute` method, supplying the argument "update 1 d/30 c/260 m/chest t/home", which was entered by the user. 
- Step 2: `LogicManager` calls the `exerciseBookParser`'s `parseCommand` method, supplying the user input.
- Step 3: In `parseCommand`, the user input is parsed and its command word (`update`) is matched to the `UpdateCommandParser`. `UpdateCommandParser`'s `parse` method is called, passing in the parsed arguments.
- Step 4: In `UpdateCommandParser`'s `parse` method, a `EditExerciseDescriptor` object
is created. Each field of the parsed arguments are added to the `EditExerciseDescriptor` object. `UpdateCommandParser` then creates an `UpdateCommand` object containing the index of the `exercise` to edit and the `EditExerciseDescriptor` object. In the sequence diagram, the argument `index` refers
to the `Index` object representing the index of the first exercise, while `editExerciseDescriptor`
refers to the `EditExerciseDescriptor` object that contains the data (from the parsed
arguments) to update.
- Step 5: `LogicManager` obtains the `UpdateCommand` object, which is referenced by the `command` variable. It then executes the `execute` method of  the `UpdateCommand` object.
- Step 6: In the `execute` method, the `UpdateCommand` object calls `getFilteredExerciseList` to 
to obtain `lastShownExerciseList`. The `Exercise` to edit is retrieved from the `lastShownExerciseList` using the `index`, and assigned to `exerciseToEdit`. Another `Exercise` object, named `editedExercise` is created to hold the data to be updated. The `UpdateCommand` object then calls the `setExercise` method of `Model`, with `exerciseToEdit` and `editedExercise`.
- Step 7: A new `CommandResult` is created containing the message to be displayed to the user,
which is "Edited Exercise: Name: running Description: 30 Date: 10-12-2020 Calories: 260 Muscles worked:[chest] Tags: [home]". This `CommandResult` is returned to `LogicManager`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The activation bar
of commandResult should be joined to the side of the box representing the commandResult instance.
Due to a limitation of PlantUML, it is not possible to do so here.
