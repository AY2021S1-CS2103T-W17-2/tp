## 1. About This Guide

This document serves as a developer guide for Calo App with sufficient and comprehensive overview of the software
so that new developers, like you, will have a working knowledge of the application by the end of the guide.  

Note that this guide only provide reasonable depth. By no means this guide serves as a replacement for the actual code. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Setting Up

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Design

### 3.1. Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ExerciseMainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#36-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#32-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#34-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2. UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ExerciseListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 3.3. Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ExerciseBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an exercise).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 3.4. Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ExerciseModel.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the Exercise book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Exercise>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ExerciseBook`, which `Exercise` references. This allows `ExerciseBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Exercise` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### 3.5. Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the exercise book data in json format and read it back.

### 3.6. Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1. Searching for specific `exercise`

(by Xinyi)

This section addresses how the `find` and `recall` commands work. 

The `find` command allows users to search through the Exercise Book based on what users enter for the `Field`s. Users should enter at least one `Field`. The search results can then be displayed in the GUI's Exercise Book.

`Field`s here indicate which `Exercise` attributes we are interested in. Exact search finds `Exercise` objects with values that exactly match the user-specified values of the fields (`Name`, `Description`, `Date` ,`Calories`).
Meanwhile, keyword search finds matches for the user-entered keywords in any part of the `Name` or any part of the `Description`.
If the user uses exact search and keyword search together, it will find `Exercise` objects that match both the exact search and keyword search.

Meanwhile, the `recall` command allows users to search for the most recent exercise with the specific name entered by the user.

The above commands rely on `FindCommand` and `RecallCommand` objects respectively. Objects of both classes use a `Predicate<Exercise>` object to filter through the `Exercise` list,
and the exercises that evaluate the predicates to be true will be listed in GUI Exercise List.

#### 4.1.1. Implementation

To search via the user-specified `Exercise` attributes, We use `FindCommandParser` to create the `PropertiesMatchPredicate` with all the user inputs. This predicate returns true only when the exercise matches all the given fields.
This predicate is then used to construct a new `FindCommand` object, which changes the GUI display when executed.

The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `find` command works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

How the `find` command works:

Step 1: `LogicManager` executes the user input, using `ExerciseBookParser` to realise this is a `find` command, and create a new `FindCommandParser` object.

Step 2: The `FindCommandParser` object parses the user-entered arguments, and creates a `PropertiesMatchPredicate`.

Step 3: This `PropertiesMatchPredicate` object is  then used to construct a new `FindCommand` object, returned to `LogicManager`.

Step 4: `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method of the created `FindCommand`, which filters for `Exercise` objects that evaluate the predicate created previously to be true.
It then returns a new CommandResult object reflecting the status of the execution. These changes are eventually reflected in the GUI.

The `find` command therefore searches through the existing Exercise List and then displays the relevant search results in the GUIâ€™s Exercise List.


To search for the most recent exercise with the user-specified `Name`, we use `RecallCommandParser` to parse the user input and create a new `RecallCommand` object with the parsed input.
The `RecallCommand` then goes through the existing Exercise List to find the most recent date, creates the `TheMostRecentDatePredicate`, and updates the GUI display when executed.

The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `recall` command works:
![findSequenceDiagram](images/recallSequenceDiagram.png)

How the `recall` command works:

Step 1: `LogicManager` executes the user input, using `ExerciseBookParser` to realise this is a `recall` command, and create a new `RecallCommandParser` object.

Step 2: The `RecallCommandParser` object parses the user-entered arguments, and creates a `RecallCommand` object which is returned to `LogicManager`.

Step 3: `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method of the created `RecallCommand`, which creates the `TheMostRecentDatePredicate` and filters for `Exercise` objects that evaluate the predicate created previously to be true.
It then returns a new CommandResult object reflecting the status of the execution. These changes are eventually reflected in the GUI.

The `recall` command therefore searches for the most recent exercise with the specified name in the existing Exercise List and then displays the relevant search results in the GUI.

#### 4.1.2. Design considerations

##### Aspect: Case-sensitivity for user inputs
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The inputs for `Name`, `Description`, and `Keyword` are case-insensitive.
  * Pros: More user-friendly.
  * Cons: Cannot get precise results if the user wants to search in a case-sensitive way.

* **Alternative 2:** The inputs for `Name`, `Description`, and `Keyword` are case-sensitive.
  * Pros: Users can get exact match for their inputs. e.g. Push Up will not match push UP.
  * Cons: It is likely that users cannot clearly remember the case of `Name`s and `Description`s of the exercises. The `find` command will be harder for the user to use.

##### Aspect: How to find and display the most recent exercise
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Goes through the Exercise Book to find the most recent date and filters for the `Exercise` with specified `Name` and `Date`
  * Pros: Easy to implement. Uses the same exercise list as other commands do.
  * Cons: Users cannot get other information except for the most recent `Exercise`.

* **Alternative 2:** Get all the `Exercise`s with the specified name and reorder them by most recent.
  * Pros: Users can take a look at other similar `Exercise`s besides the most recent one.
  * Cons: Needs to create another Exercise List. Other commands will not work on the newly created list.
