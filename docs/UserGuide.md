Calo is a desktop app that is **designed for keeping track of calories burnt throughout the day**. It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a skilled typer, you can carry out various tasks such as adding new exercises and checking records for previous days much faster than the traditional GUI apps.

**Q**: How to load my archived file?<br>
**A**: For now, you can delete the `entry.txt` file in the `data` folder and rename the archived file of your choices to `entry.txt`. In subsequent updates, we will introduce a command to load archived files via Command Line Interface.
